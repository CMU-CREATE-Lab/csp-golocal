      <h1>Catering Tips</h1>

      <p>If you are buying food with a university purchasing card for the first time, here are some tips for making everything go smoothly:</p>

      <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-heading">
            <h4 class="panel-title">
              <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse1">1. Give the food business some advance notice</a>
            </h4>
          </div>
          <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">Depending on the size of your event, you may need to give more notice than you think. Small events (10 lunches or so) can be ordered a day ahead or sometimes less (ie. pizzas, sub sandwiches, other shared items), but as the event size increases you should build in time to give your vendor notice of your needs.</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-heading">
            <h4 class="panel-title">
              <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse2">2. Minimum orders</a>
            </h4>
          </div>
          <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">Some vendors have minimum order sizes, particularly if you need delivery to campus. This makes it worthwhile for the vendor. If you have a smaller order you can offer to pick it up or see if the vendor has delivery through a service like GrubHub, though this will add a cost.</div>

          <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">No food business wants you to run out of food at your event, so if food waste bothers you feel free to reduce the number of attendees by about 10%. This will save some money and you will have less leftovers to deal with.</div>

          <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">Other ways to cut costs and waste include buying bottled drinks and side items like chips, fruit, and cookies at a grocery store, since these can be bought ahead of your event. Go green by providing a pitcher and cups for water rather than bottled water.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">Check in with University Contracts for anything more than drop off catering - If your event is bringing an outside caterer to campus to set up, serve/bartend, and clean up you will need a contract because these are services. If you are not sure, you can always contact University Contracts (university-contracts@andrew.cmu.edu) and ask questions. You want to have a fully-executed contract when you bring catering to campus.</div>
